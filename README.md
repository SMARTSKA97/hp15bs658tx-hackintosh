# Hp 15bs 661tx Opencore EFI
The long awaited update to this repository has finally arrived. I have moved on to Open Core from Clover and you should do that too. Open core feels much more efficient even though it takes some time to understand. But, nevertheless I was able to install Catalina 1.15.7 on this laptop.

## Specifications
CPU: Intel i3 6th Gen (Skylake)

iGPU: Intel HD 520

dGPU: Radeon 520 (Disabled)

RAM: 8GB

## What all does not work as of now
Touchpad Buttons (Idk its happening again)

Ethernet (Might have to downgrade a few kernel extensions)

Wifi & Bluetooth (Either replace the Realtek one inside or u use an external one. The one it was shipped with was crappy af anyways)
