# Hp 15bs661tx Opencore EFI [Supports Big Sur]
This EFI Config now supports Big Sur as well. So if you want to upgrade you can promptly do so but I would suggest to do a fresh installation instead. Also, in case you haven't made any modifications to the laptop or have done any upgrades, I suggest buying a SATA m.2 SSD of either ~120G or ~240G as it will really help you. Trust me. It will enhance the experience if you are planning on upgrading to Big Sur.

I personally think that this i3 CPU isn't really cut out for Big Sur as I am a power user and I'd probably upgrade this laptop's motherboard with either an 8th gen i5 or and 8th ge n i7. That would really make this thing mark unto today's standards at least. Also I would recommend you to go buy the supported intel WLAN + BT card for this which can be made to work with Mac OS using intelwm. If I ever get the chance and money to make these updates I would really do so and you should also consider some of them.

As of now I think the EFI is almost complete except for a few things like DRM and stuff. (I don't have a Netflix account to use currently. If u do then please let me know) Also I think Mac OS drains the battery faster than windows but I haven't officially tested it yet. **Enhancements and improvements are always welcome**

## Specifications
CPU: Intel i3 6th Gen (Skylake)

iGPU: Intel HD 520

dGPU: Radeon 520 (Disabled)

RAM: 8GB

## What all does not work as of now

Wifi & Bluetooth (Either replace the Realtek one inside or u use an external one. The one it was shipped with was crappy af anyways)

```
For Networking I am mainly reliant on Ethernet and the USB WIFI dongle that I have of D-Link. Fortunately it supports Catalina (Haven't tested on Big Sur yet) but it only supports the ban standard and not ac so that's a downside. There is no way to enable bluetooth right now as I don't have a bluetooth dongle right now :(
